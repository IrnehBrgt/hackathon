      <h3>Common Mistakes That Junior Developers Should Avoid</h3>
      <p>
        Career as a developer in any sector is pretty challenging. The
        profession can appear even more daunting when you are a junior
        developer. The lack of formal training about real-world software
        development scenarios during college days leaves the developers to learn
        on their own. Hence, they make many novice mistakes that stick for a
        long time. Without proper guidance, the initial habits can slow down the
        junior developer’s career progression. Everyone makes several of these
        beginner’s mistakes during the initial phases of their career. If you
        are passionate about making it big in your development sector, here is a
        list of the top ten common mistakes you need to be aware of as a junior
        developer.

      <h3>Not Knowing Their Self Worth</h3>
      <p>
        When developers are fresh out of their institutions or when they are out
        in the market looking for a job, they most likely have no idea about
        their worth. Depending on individuals, they either overestimate their
        capability or underestimate it. In either case, not knowing is not
        helpful to get the right start to their career. Developers who
        overestimate their capabilities tend to have high expectations from
        their first job. They feel they are doing the company a favor. This
        mindset reflects in the interviews and, later, in their work. Again,
        developers who underestimate their abilities tend to take the very first
        offer they get. They do not try to find out if they are paid as per the
        market standard. They also prefer not to ask what kind of work they will
        be offered or whether the work culture is flexible and a good fit for
        them. It is not always easy to negotiate during your first job search.
        Circumstances can compel you to start earning as early as possible. If
        that is the case, surely you can latch on to the first software job you
        get. Once you start making money, you can further your career in your
        own time and money. You can also find out if a position is suitable for
        you by doing a bit of research on the internet. Learn about the company
        culture from the reviews provided by employees on various sites.

      <h3>Focusing on Code Instead of the Big Picture</h3>
      <p>
        It’s easy to get bogged down in the details when you’re starting out.
        But it’s important to remember that code is only a small part of the
        development process. Focusing on the big picture will help you
        understand the overall goal of your project and help you make better
        decisions. To come up with good solutions, you need to spend time
        thinking. You have to remember that the author of React did not come up
        with the idea for the framework in a day. You have to focus on your
        target and follow up on whatever you need to get to that target.
